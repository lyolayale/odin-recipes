  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peanut_butter_and_jelly_sandwich">Wikipedia's Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwich</a> :
    "A peanut butter and jelly sandwich (PB&J) consists of peanut butter and fruit preserves—jelly—spread on bread. The sandwich may be open-faced, made of a single slice of bread folded over, or made between two slices of bread. The sandwich is popular in the United States, especially among children; a 2002 survey showed the average American will eat 1,500 before graduating from high school.[1] There are many variations on the sandwich, starting with the basic peanut butter sandwich or jam sandwich." - <i>Wikipedia</i>
