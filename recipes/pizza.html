  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza">Wikipedia's Pizza : </a>"Pizza (Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple, meat, etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.[1] A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.

In Italy, pizza served in a restaurant is presented unsliced, and is eaten with the use of a knife and fork.[2][3] In casual settings, however, it is cut into wedges to be eaten while held in the hand." - <i>Wikipedia</i></p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>1 package (1/4 ounce) active dry yeast</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon sugar
</li>
<li>1-1/4 cups warm water (110° to 115°)
</li>
<li>1/4 cup canola oil
